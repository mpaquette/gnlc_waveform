# Gradient Non-Linearity Correction for Arbitrary Gradient Waveform

This repository is in collaboration with [Chantal M.W. Tax](https://github.com/ChantalTax) and [Cornelius Eichner](https://github.com/cornelius-eichner)



We currently support ["Topgaard style"](https://github.com/daniel-topgaard/md-dmri/blob/master/acq/bruker/paravision/make_waveform.m) and ["NOW style"](https://github.com/jsjol/NOW) waveform files.

**btensor.py** contains the basic function to compute q-vectors and B-tensor with and without gradient non-linearity distorsion.
